# DriftingMe Bible
*A Noir Comic Series*

## Core Concept

**DriftingMe** is a psychological noir comic series that explores the disorienting experience of waking up in lives that aren't your own. Each episode follows characters who find themselves trapped in unfamiliar realities, questioning their identity, memory, and the nature of consciousness itself.

## Visual Identity

### Art Style
- **Medium**: Black and white comic book illustration
- **Technique**: Cross-hatching and film grain texture
- **Lighting**: Chiaroscuro (high contrast light and shadow)
- **Inspiration**: Classic film noir, graphic novels like "Sin City"
- **Mood**: Gritty, atmospheric, psychologically intense

### Visual Elements
- **Clean Geometric Shadows**: Precise venetian blind patterns, sharp prison bar effects
- **Minimalist Composition**: Bold black shapes on white backgrounds
- **Abstract Architecture**: Simplified interior forms, geometric window frames  
- **Pure Contrast**: Sharp blacks and whites, no texture or noise
- **Stylized Forms**: Vector-like illustration approach, graphic design aesthetic

## Narrative Structure

### Episode Format
Each episode follows a character experiencing "The Drift" - waking up in someone else's life with fragmented memories and growing awareness that reality has shifted.

### Recurring Themes
- **Identity Crisis**: Who am I when I'm not myself?
- **Memory vs. Reality**: What's real when memories contradict experience?
- **Psychological Isolation**: Trapped between worlds, belonging to neither
- **Urban Alienation**: City as maze, apartment as prison cell

## Character Archetypes

### The Drifter
- **Role**: Protagonist experiencing the shift
- **Psychology**: Disoriented, questioning, gradually awakening to their situation  
- **Visual**: Masculine figure with clear, defined features - strong jawline, clear eyes
- **Design**: Clean comic book character design - NOT abstract or Picasso-style
- **Features**: Recognizable human proportions, bold outlines, classic noir hero aesthetic

### The Other Life
- **Role**: The life/identity the Drifter has "borrowed"
- **Psychology**: Unknown, mysterious, revealed through environmental storytelling
- **Visual**: Shown through possessions, photographs, spaces that feel foreign

## Episode 1: "The Awakening"

### Scene 1 – The Awakening

**Setting:**
A dim bedroom before dawn. Soft blue-gray light filters through rain-streaked windows, sliced by the harsh geometry of venetian-blind shadows. The air feels heavy — still, except for the faint sound of rain and distant city hum.

**Action:**
- A man jolts awake, heart racing
- Moment of stillness — only his eyes flicker across the unfamiliar room
- The sheets, the smell, the woman asleep beside him — none of it feels like his life
- He props himself on one elbow, breathing shallowly, afraid to disturb the illusion
- Shadows crawl across his face like bars
- Realization: he's not where he went to sleep

**Mood & Tone:**
Noir-gritty, tense, introspective. Everything is drenched in contrast — black and gray ink, punctuated by slivers of white light. The atmosphere conveys disorientation and unease rather than outright panic.

**Visual Approach:**
- **Panel 1**: Medium shot — man in bed, woman half-seen, venetian blind shadows
- **Panel 2**: Close-up — eyes wide with confusion and fear
- **Panel 3**: Wide shot — unfamiliar room establishing the alien environment
- **Panel 4**: Symbolic — shadow bars across his face, metaphor for imprisonment

**Technical Specs:**
- Clean minimalist noir illustration (NO cross-hatching)
- Sharp geometric shadow patterns (NO texture/grain)
- Pure black and white contrast with bold clean lines
- Portrait orientation (768x1024) for comic panel format
- Vector-like graphic novel aesthetic

## Production Guidelines

### Panel Composition
- **Establishing Shots**: Wide views to show environment and mood
- **Medium Shots**: Character interaction and emotional beats  
- **Close-ups**: Psychological intensity, eyes, expressions
- **Symbolic Shots**: Visual metaphors (shadows, reflections, windows)

### Lighting Philosophy
- **Dawn/Dusk**: Preferred times for emotional ambiguity
- **Venetian Blinds**: Signature visual element creating geometric shadows
- **Rain**: Adds texture and atmosphere to windows and streets
- **Single Light Sources**: Table lamps, street lights for dramatic contrast

### Narrative Pacing
- **Silent Panels**: Use visual storytelling over dialogue
- **Internal Monologue**: Minimal, when used should be introspective
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Let objects and spaces tell the story
- **Gradual Revelation**: Mystery unfolds through visual discovery

## Technical Production

### Image Generation Parameters
- **Resolution**: 768x1024 (portrait comic panel)
- **Style**: Noir comic book, black and white
- **Technique**: Cross-hatching, high contrast
- **Mood**: Chiaroscuro lighting, film grain texture
