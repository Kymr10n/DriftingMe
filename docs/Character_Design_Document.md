# DriftingMe - Main Character Design Document

## Character Identity: "The Drifter"

### Core Concept
The protagonist is an everyman figure who experiences the disorienting shift between realities. He represents the audience's entry point into the psychological noir world of DriftingMe.

### Visual Design Philosophy
Following the clean geometric noir style established by the reference images:
- **Minimalist geometric features** - no unnecessary detail
- **Bold silhouettes** - recognizable in shadow
- **Architectural precision** - clean lines, sharp angles
- **Abstract masculinity** - stylized but clearly male
- **Consistent proportions** - maintainable across panels

## Character Design Elements

### Facial Structure (Front View)
- **Geometric jawline** - strong, angular definition
- **Simplified eye design** - abstract but expressive
- **Minimal hair form** - clean geometric shape, no texture
- **Stylized nose** - bold, architectural lines
- **Expression range** - confusion, realization, tension

### Profile Characteristics (Side View)  
- **Strong profile silhouette** - instantly recognizable
- **Angular nose bridge** - geometric precision
- **Clean hairline** - bold shape against head form
- **Jaw definition** - maintains strength in profile
- **Consistent proportions** - matches front view

### Body Language & Posture
- **Sitting on bed edge** - vulnerable, uncertain posture
- **Awakening gestures** - hands to head, propped on elbows
- **Standing silhouettes** - clean geometric body form
- **Shadow studies** - maintains recognition in pure silhouette

## Generated Character Studies

### Core Reference Sheet (Fixed Seed: 12345678)
Generated: November 7, 2025

1. **character_profile_front** (3 variations)
   - Files: 752-878KB each
   - Purpose: Primary character design reference
   - Style: Clean geometric facial features, front-facing

2. **character_profile_side** (3 variations)  
   - Files: 728-882KB each
   - Purpose: Side profile consistency check
   - Style: Strong silhouette, architectural precision

3. **character_awakening_closeup** (3 variations)
   - Files: 707-930KB each  
   - Purpose: Emotional expression in awakening scene
   - Style: Confusion/disorientation, venetian blind shadows

4. **character_silhouette_bed** (3 variations)
   - Files: 664-826KB each
   - Purpose: Scene-specific posture reference  
   - Style: Pure silhouette, geometric shadow patterns

## Character Consistency Guidelines

### Key Features to Maintain:
- **Facial geometry** - consistent angular jawline and eye placement
- **Hair form** - same geometric shape across all views
- **Body proportions** - standardized height/build ratio
- **Shadow response** - how venetian blind patterns fall across features

### Style Specifications:
- **Line weight** - bold, clean strokes
- **Shadow treatment** - geometric patterns, hard edges
- **Detail level** - minimal, abstract features only
- **Contrast** - pure black and white, no grays except for shadows

## Usage in Scenes

### Scene 1 Applications:
- **Panel 1** (Room overview): Use silhouette studies for distant figure
- **Panel 2** (Medium shot): Use awakening closeup for facial expression  
- **Panel 3** (Close-up): Use profile studies for detailed face work
- **Panel 4** (Symbolic): Use shadow studies for metaphorical compositions

### Character Arc Considerations:
- **Episode 1**: Confusion and disorientation (wide eyes, uncertain posture)
- **Future episodes**: Growing awareness, determination, fear
- **Visual evolution**: Maintain core design while showing emotional progression

## Technical Production Notes

### Generation Parameters (Optimized for Character):
- **CFG Scale**: 6.5 (lower for cleaner character work)
- **Steps**: 25 (prevents over-processing)
- **Sampler**: DPM++ 2M Karras (clean output)
- **Seed Strategy**: Fixed seed (12345678) for consistency studies

### File Management:
- All character files prefixed with "character_"
- Variations numbered v1, v2, v3 for selection
- File sizes: 650-950KB (indicating clean output)

## Next Development Phase

### Immediate Needs:
1. Select best variation from each study
2. Generate detailed feature studies (hands, eyes)
3. Create character consistency test sheet
4. Develop emotional expression range

### Future Character Work:
- Supporting characters (woman in bed, background figures)
- Character in different clothing/situations  
- Age/time progression studies
- Interaction poses with other characters

## Style Evolution Tracking

This character design successfully captures:
✅ Clean geometric noir aesthetic  
✅ Architectural precision in features
✅ Bold silhouette recognition
✅ Minimal texture/noise
✅ Consistent with environmental style
✅ Suitable for venetian blind shadow overlay

The character design aligns perfectly with the refined visual style established in the latest scene generation tests.
